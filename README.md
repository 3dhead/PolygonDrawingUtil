A compact Android utility for constructing and drawing rounded regular polygons.

Consumers can specify:

- number of sides (â‰¥ 3);
- center coordinates;
- outer radius (center to vertex);
- corner rounding radius;
- polygon rotation;
- fill/stroke [`Paint`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html).

This video was captured using the sample application in this repository. It provides convenient controls for exploring `PolygonDrawingUtil`'s capabilities.

# Getting Started

1. Specify PolygonDrawingUtil as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
      implementation 'com.stkent:polygondrawingutil:1.1.0'
    }
    ```

2. Create a new `PolygonDrawingUtil` instance and assign it to a field in your custom view class:

    ```java
    private PolygonDrawingUtil polygonDrawingUtil = new PolygonDrawingUtil();
    ```

3. Call `polygonDrawUtil.drawPolygon` in your `onDraw` method:

    ```java
    @Override
    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
      super.onDraw(canvas);

      polygonDrawingUtil.drawPolygon(
          canvas,
          numberOfSides,
          centerX,
          centerY,
          polygonRadius,
          cornerRadius,
          rotation,
          polygonPaint);
    }
    ```

    Alternately, you can supply your own `Path` instance and ask `PolygonDrawingUtil` to fill it with a polygon:

    ```java
    Path myPath = new Path();

    polygonDrawingUtil.constructPolygonPath(
        myPath,
        numberOfSides,
        centerX,
        centerY,
        polygonRadius,
        cornerRadius,
        rotation);
    ```

    This allows you to perform post-processing on the `Path` before drawing to a `Canvas`.
